# API
About:
School project on how to use API with PHP, classes and functions. Information is directly written in the URL.

Database
Carts

Code rules (I've tried to keep);

Class names
If it is a class, it starts with a big letter, ex:
class User

Methods/functions
If it a method/function in a class, I user big camelcase, ex:
CreateUser

Variables
In the cases that I create a variable, I use normally the same camelcase for variables as , ex:
$userID(variable in VS code) and userID(name of column in database)

Titles of php-files
The titles of the php-files in the project are written in small camelcase, ex:
getOneUser or getAll
